# ðŸ§© Number Guessing Game

A simple command-line number guessing game built in Java. The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it within a limited number of chances depending on the selected difficulty level.

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

1. When the game starts, you'll choose a difficulty level:
   - **Easy**: 10 chances
   - **Medium**: 5 chances
   - **Hard**: 3 chances

2. Enter your guesses one by one.

3. The game will tell you whether the number is greater or less than your guess.

4. If you guess correctly, you win! Otherwise, the game ends when you run out of chances.


## ðŸš€ Future Improvements

Here are some planned features to enhance the game:

- **Timer Feature**: Add a timer to see how long it takes the user to guess the number, adding a speed challenge element to the game.

- **High Score Tracking**: Keep track of the user's high score (i.e., the fewest number of attempts it took to guess the number under a specific difficulty level).
